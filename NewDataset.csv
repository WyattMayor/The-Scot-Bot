It is designed as a natural progression from Biology 150, though Biology 155 may be taken independently. Beginning with an  introduction to the mechanisms of evolution, we will investigate the evolutionary history of biological diversity, the structure and function of organisms, and the ecological contexts in which organisms interact and evolution occurs. In lab, we will investigate the broad range of biological diversity including: bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and animals. Alternatively, those of you enrolled in the SEA-PHAGES lab will investigate how we make sense of biodiversity at the genetic level, an area known as bioinformatics.

We plan to spend as much time in the field as possible, so short of a blizzard or tornado threat, we will try to go out. That means you need to come prepared with appropriate clothing: rain gear, layers, hats/sunglasses. Bugs should be less of an issue, but bring some insect repellent if they bug you. A hat will keep them out of your hair. We may wind up going through some wet areas; dry socks and shoes may make you more comfortable on your ride back to campus. Waterproof, GORTEX boots may be an advantage. Sandals are a bad idea; really a terrible idea. Even on a beautiful day, I recommend wearing long pants and bringing along a long-sleeved shirt. We will be walking through nasty things like poison ivy, stinging nettles, buckthorn, etc. (these are the plants of Illinois!). A layer of clothing between you and them will keep you more comfortable, and may save on itches later. Bring water to stave off dehydration. Bring a snack if you are likely to get the munchies in the early afternoon - we are not likely to run into too many vending machines.

So we will take some time in the field to hone our skills at photography. How much emphasis we place on photography as we move through the course will depend upon several factors, including your level of interest in photography as a class, and the number of suitable cameras available for our use. If you have a digital SLR camera, you are strongly encouraged to bring it with you into the field (with appropriate precautions taken to protect your equipment from the elements). If you have been thinking about getting a digital SLR for some time, but just havent gotten around to it, now might the time: you will have lots of opportunity to learn to use it well.  Come talk with me if you are interested in exploring botanical drawing.  Attendance: You can skip whatever classes or labs you want. Youre adults, and I dont take it personally. You might get an e-mail from me just to check up and make certain all is well. If you are absent, you remain responsible for any material/deadlines assigned that day, and I will not provide assignments under these circumstances by e-mail unless you are unable to come to my office. ", Is there any way to explore botanical drawing? ,"  Yes, come talk with me if you are interested. "

Although fungi are heterotrophic and are more closely related to animals than to plants, we will consider fungi as well, partly in deference to historical treatments of fungi under the general heading of Botany, partly to provide us with another life-strategy to compare with that of terrestrial plants, partly because fungi would not otherwise receive the coverage they warrant in the curriculum, and primarily because most of what we think of as plants are in fact  embryophyte/fungal symbioses.  This course employs lecture and primary-literature discussion components to provide you with a comprehensive introduction to major topics in fundamental plant biology. Our treatment of photosynthetic organisms and fungi will integrate spatial scales moving from biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics, through cell biology, physiology and development, and ecology.
