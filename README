Hello, This project is called The Scot Bot! The purpose of this project is to allow students to ask questions about any class with any professor and have a relatively accurate response. Although, This project was made for Monmouth College it can be adapted and implemented for any College/University.

Step 1: Setup
    -Go through and set all the openai API keys to your personal openai API keys
    -Run the setup file to install necassary libraries

Step 2: Dataset Creation
    - Change all the names of the syllabi to follow the naming convention "Department,Class Number, Class Name, Class Year, Professor.docx"
    - Run the Simple Dataset Creation Python script

Step 3: Adapt GUI
    - Change the name of the bot to whatever you want
    - Change the Logo to your schools logo

Step 4: Ask away!

This is my senior capstone project for Monmouth College.
If you use this all I ask is for some credit to be given.
