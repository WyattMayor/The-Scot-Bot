Verbatim copying of text is specifically disallowed, but so is  taking a source and rearranging some phrases and changing some variable names to create a derivative  version! Such behavior is definitely NOT using your own words. It does not matter if you helped  contribute to this source text with others, since then you are still not the sole author of the text. The point of  collaborating on an assignment is not to produce a jointly authored set of solutions, since that violates the  course policies. Instead, it is to help you solve the problems, which sometimes involve a bit of creativity. After you have jointly come up with the ideas you need to solve the problems, though, you should part ways with your group and sit down to do the writing by yourself. I also advise against sharing the writeup you submit with others, since if someone else uses your text as a source for their own solution (with or without your permission), you will also be implicated in the violation of the academic integrity policy. In any case, if two nearly identical solutions are received, we have no way of tell which is the original, and the policy is to not award credit for either submission.",COMP,350,Machine Learning,Utterback,2018

It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the  resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your  collaborations to the instructor. You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you  cannot you likely do not really know the material. One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard.

",POLS,103,American Politics,Audette,2022
"This class is POLS 103, American Politics, taught by Audette in 2022. The report should include a thesis as to why one side of the debate is more correct than the other, followed by your reasons. The main focus should be your critique of the arguments, arguing for or against one side, and/or offering a perspective not taken by either side. Keep the summarizing to a minimum only enough to show that you understand the debate. The main goal of these papers is to help you develop arguments based on logic and facts rather than unsubstantiated claims and opinions. You are not required to do any outside research (but please cite your sources if you do), and you will not be graded on which side of the debate you take. Papers should be turned in via email only.  Homework Assignments  The homework assignments are two short papers (about 2-3 pages long) to prepare you for the final paper in this class. The first will ask you to select an event during your lifetime and discuss how it demonstrates whether the U.S. is or is not democratic. The second will ask you to choose a measure of U.S. democracy (provided to you) and write a summary and reaction to that measure.

You should develop an argument in about 5-7 pages and cover what you believe to be the main issues in support of your argument and defending against the main critiques of your argument. Papers should be turned in via email only.  Participation  A large part of our class will be based on discussion, especially during our debates; therefore, it is essential that you come to class ready to actively participate. This includes (but is not limited to): attending class regularly, carefully reading the assigned texts, sharing your thoughts, opinions, and insights in discussion, considering and raising opposing viewpoints, engaging in respectful dialogue with others, listening attentively to others perspectives, and following the discussion policies listed in this syllabus.

The Java Tutorials. 2016. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ We will also pull material from How to Design Classes by Felleisen et. al., available at http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDC/htdc.pdf. In addition, I will assign readings from a multitude of other internet sources. Links to these sources will be posted on this webpage as needed. Programming Environment All programs written in this course are required to compile and run on a Linux computer with Java 8 and the Eclipse IDE. You will probably be okay with the recently-released Java 9, but the department server has Java JRE/JDK 8 installed (along with Eclipse). This software can be accessed via a VNC desktop session. While development is not required in this  environment, failure to properly port a program to the required environment could result in a program not compiling correctly when it is being graded. All software for this course is available free of charge from Oracle and the Eclipse Foundation.",COMP,210,Object Oriented Programming,Utterback,2018

Minimally, a violation will result in an F or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the students course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of F and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal.

The primary focus of this course is the design and development of algorithms and programs using data abstraction and information hiding via abstract data types ADTs. Data abstraction is absolutely fundamental to good programming practice and the management of large scale problems and data sets. This course is designed to round out a students understanding of basic computer science concepts while strengthening the program design and development skills through continued use of an object-oriented design methodology. It is imperative that programmers and program designers be able to determine which of the many solutions available is the best for their specific task. Throughout the course, students will focus on to making solid quantitative and qualitative judgments about program efficiency and overall program design choices.

It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the  resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your  collaborations to the instructor. You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you  cannot you likely do not really know the material. One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard.

You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you  cannot you likely do not really know the material. One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard.

The primary focus of this course is the design and development of algorithms and programs using data abstraction and information hiding via abstract data types ADTs. Data abstraction is absolutely fundamental to good programming practice and the management of large scale problems and data sets. This course is designed to round out a students understanding of basic computer / science concepts while strengthening the program design and development skills through continued use of a test-driven design methodology. It is imperative that programmers and program designers be able to determine which of the many solutions available is the best for their specific task. Throughout the course, students will focus on to making solid quantitative and qualitative judgments about program efficiency and overall program design choices. Gone are the days when it works is a good enough assessment for the quality of a program. Students will explore the ideas and concepts brought up in class and homework assignments during the weekly lab session. In addition to hands on exercises, lab sessions will be used to explore current, relevant research in computer science.",COMP,220,Data Structures,Utterback,2018

Programming Environment This course utilizes the Code::Blocks IDE and the GNU compiler for C++ development. All programs written in this course are required to compile and run on a server running Ubuntu 18.04.1. All students will have access to the departmental server and thereby the above development tools. While development is not required in this environment, failure to properly port a program to the required environment could result in your program not compiling correctly at the time of grading. Further, I may not be able to provide support for installing and using other development environments. All software for this course is available free of charge and can be found on the web if students wish to install it on their personal machines.",COMP,220,Data Structures,Utterback,2018
"This class is COMP 220, Data Structures, taught by Utterback in 2018. Policies Late assignments: In general, late assignments will not be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for  situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to  plead your case. Academic dishonesty: Monmouth Colleges official policy on academic dishonesty can be found here. / You are responsible for reading and complying with that policy. In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an F or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the students course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of F and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations",COMP,220,Data Structures,Utterback,2018
"This class is COMP 220, Data Structures, taught by Utterback in 2018. Collaboration: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you it is fine to seek help  from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, copying of answers and any act worthy of the label of cheating is never permissible! It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the  resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your  collaborations to the instructor. You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you  cannot you likely do not really know the material. One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the material!",COMP,220,Data Structures,Utterback,2018
"This class is COMP 220, Data Structures, taught by Utterback in 2018. When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student must turn in an assignment representing their own work. Electronic devices: Do not use your phone in class. Keep it on silent or leave it at home. Any computer or  tablet usage should be related to the course. Other usage is rude and distracting to others. General expectations: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take responsibility for your own  learning. You are here to learn, so work hard and be professional. Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the material. Read the text, use the resources  available at Monmouth College, and go beyond the material. If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on that day. College is, in some sense,  your job. Take pride in creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and present  your answers neatly and orderly. Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material show your work!

Assessment Assignments The course workload is as follows: Category Number Of Assignments Labs 10 / Category Number Of Assignments Homework 810 Projects 2 Exams 67 Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for it or follow a lab to complete it. Students are also encouraged to look at the textbooks review questions, since the solutions are available online. There will be no dedicated midterm or final exam, but 7 exams spaced throughout the semester. Each exam will focus primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered since the previous exam. The final exam will include a small number of cumulative questions, and I reserve the right to include at most one cumulative question on each of the other exams. Your lowest non-final exam score will be dropped. Workload The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on average should be about 13 hours per week.
